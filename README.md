Project Description
Valanja Vazhi is a cutting-edge (read: totally unnecessary) navigation website that specializes in one thing: taking you the longest possible way to anywhere.
It’s not about the destination, it’s about the detours, the jams, and the existential crises along the way.

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
People are reaching places on time. They are attending weddings before the sadya, job interviews before HR leaves, and even catching the first show at the theatre.
We cannot let this happen.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We find traffic. If there isn’t any, we create some (mentally).

We take turns where even Google Maps says, "Bro, I don’t know this road."

We serve wisdom on the go:

"Vazhi thetti poyi alle?"

"Sheri enna nammakk povam."

"Ee vazhi aano? ithinekkal nalla road njan kanichu tharam."

"inganonnum alleda."

"onnu pethiye poda enikk ee deshathe vazhi ariyillann."
