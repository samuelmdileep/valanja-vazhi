## 📝 Project Description  
Valanja Vazhi is a *cutting-edge* (read: totally unnecessary) **navigation website** 🗺️ that specializes in one thing: **taking you the longest possible way to anywhere** 🚗💨.  
It’s not about the destination — it’s about the detours, the jams 🚦, and the mild existential crises 🤯 along the way.  

---

## 🤦 The Problem (that doesn’t exist)  
People are reaching places **on time** ⏰.  
They’re:  
- 🍛 Attending weddings before the *sadya*  
- 💼 Reaching job interviews before HR leaves  
- 🎬 Catching the first show at the theatre  

❌ We cannot let this happen.  

---

## 💡 The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
- 🕵️ We **find** traffic. If there isn’t any, we **mentally create some**.  
- 🌀 We take turns where even Google Maps says: *"Bro… I don’t know this road."*  
- 💬 We offer top-tier roadside wisdom like:  
  - "Vazhi thetti poyi alle?" 😏  
  - "Sheri enna nammakk povam." 🤷‍♂️  
  - "Ee vazhi aano? Ithinekkal nalla road njan kanichu tharam." 🚧  
  - "Inganonnum alleda." 🙅‍♂️  
  - "Onnu pethiye poda… enikk ee deshathe vazhi ariyillann." 😂
